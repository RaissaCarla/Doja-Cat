Whoa, whoa, ooh
(Welcome to the camp)
I hide my face and run far away (whoa, whoa, ooh)
I get crazy, angsty when you get under my skin
The power it takes to make me cry that way (mwah)
Baby, I hate me (yeah) when you get under my skin (when you, yeah)
Another glass, broke the other glass
Technically, it wasn't me, I'm sober now (now)
You get all in a mood when it's overcast (cast)
I get all in a mood when it's over cash (yeah)
I'm over that (I'm over that), you notice that? (That)
Other couples be cussin' and fightin' over tabs
Baby, take another tab, come and hold my ass (just hold me)
Don't you ever in your life call me "Doja Cat" (nah)
I don't sign titties on my coffee dates (nah)
I emptied out your motherfuckin' Coffee-Mate
I could show you crazy if you call me cray
I ate a pussy for you, don't you call me gay
You out here actin' like you sniffin' on some Carly Rae
Cartier on you, but you barkin' like you Cardi B (yeah-yeah)
You ain't stupid, but you probably ain't as smart as me
I told the concierge to change the lock for the apartment key
I hide my face (my face) and run far away
I get crazy (crazy), angsty when you get under my skin
The power it takes to make me cry that way
Baby, I hate me when you get under my skin (yeah, hey, yeah, hey, yeah)
I stopped poutin' (-tin'), I stopped cryin' (ah)
The chef made breakfast, check the center island
DHL package came, I don't have to sign it
The toilet seats poppin' open when I walk by 'em
Put it to bed, close the black-outs
You wouldn't treat your mama like that in a Black house
Hats off to that, I can't cap now
Admit you hate seein' me with all them plaques now
Security around the clock, you gotta back down
And put the bag down, turn your ass 'round
Now that you got it front and center, face the facts now (yeah)
This what you get for leavin' bitches in the background
Quote, bitches, end quote (ah) (yeah, yeah, said I)
I hide my face and run far away
I get crazy (crazy), angsty (angsty), when you get under my skin
The power it takes to make me cry that way
Baby (baby), I hate me (hate me) when you get under my skin (my skin)

The way you know what I want

The way you save me from them dogs
Baby, it's disrespectful

Woah there, boy, don't go there, boy
Tell me how they 'posed to breathe without no air, boy
Okay, way you treat 'em ain't no fair, boy
They all wanna get a piece of them coattails, boy
Class act, put you in the business
Even in economy, I'm giving him the biscuit
Give 'em any task, any man here would risk it
For me, they ain't cuffin', that's imaginative figment
All disrespect, you ain't letting your foot off
I like it when they mad and we making they wood soft
Uh, yeah, he nice and he fine and he tall
But if I'm with him, I'm eventually finding flaws
What the heck it is? his smile and walk
He got experience and generously kind and soft
Sexy the way that he sensitive
Jealousy don't ever get the best of him
Thank God, 'cause
The way you know what I want
The way they wish I wouldn't fall
The way you save me from them dogs
Baby, it's disrespectful
Baby, it's disrespectful

All the pretty boys (get rowdy)
All the skinny boys (get rowdy)
All the big boys (get rowdy)
All the rich boys (get rowdy)
You a hustler (get rowdy)
You ain't getting funds (get rowdy)
I ain't kidding, boys, come on (get rowdy)

Can you feel the head high?
Never hold my head high
Can you feel the head high?
Never hold my head high
Can you feel the head high?
I'm so afraid to put you down
But when we're safe we're all allowed
And I got a gift, I use my voice
But you can't hear amongst the noise
There's dirt around my neck, I'm blind
No, I don't have to hear them, why? It's nice
I got a mother, y'all got moms
And they love every fuckin' song
They help me hold my-
Never hold my head high

Never hold my head high
Can you feel the head high?
Never hold my head high
Can you feel the head high?

Can you feel the head high? (Yeah)
Fatherless, I do act so fatherless
Except that's not acting, actually, I lack some confidence
They draggin' my name through the web
They should call me, "Spider Bitch"
You got no designer, you gotta take care your momma 'nem
You work 9-5s and you still managin' to comment this?
Fuck is your problem, bitch?
I know you ain't proud of this
Deep down you just wish you didn't feel stuck in the life you live
Deep down you got power to change the view they assigned you with
Lost faith in humanity
Also, lost the common sense
Also, lost the motivation to begin to find this shit
I won't take it personally, 'cause I get addicted as well
Had to wish enemies well
That's how the internet feel
Herd to hold my
Never hold my head high (hard to hold my head high)
Can you feel the head high? (Can you feel the head high?)
Never hold my head high (hard to hold my head high)
Can you feel the head high? (Can you feel the head high?)
Never hold my head high (hard to hold my head high)
Can you feel the head high? (Can you feel the head high?)

Ain't shit sweet, I brush my teeth, but still my tooth hurt (still my tooth hurt)
You can not come to the cookout, get your hand up out the cooler (cooler, bitch)
She was in my seat, I had to scooch her (I had to scooch her, I had to)
She was at her knees, I had to boot her (I had to boot her)
She just left the team like we ain't knew her (like we ain't knew her, bitch)
She just left the team like, okay, loser
Yeah, yeah (okay, loser)
I ain't all on my lonesome, they want me to loan some
I made a fortune, they can't let that go none
I'm doin' so much, that shit cost a shoulder
I don't blow it all on a VVS boulder
I put the verse in the motherfuckin' 'ace

Rock on my hand make The Rock wanna rock me
Flock to the stands 'cause my opp always watchin'

Loced out
Pistol grip in the trunk, stunt blunt
Got me doing some stupid shit, monkey bitches make me click
(Wanna fuck them kids, wanna fuck the world, wanna fuck them all, uh)
Yeah
Fuck them kids
Ain't got nice words for none of them kids
What you heard ain't what I said
You got snakes all in yo' camp
Yeah (don't, don't)
Don't make me untie my durag (don't, don't)
Don't make me send yo' ass to the gulag (don't, don't)
Don't make me open up my new bag (new bag)
Don't make me hit it off like food stamps (food stamps)
You ain't mad at me, that's hormones, bitch
Takin' beans out the bag like cornhole, bitch
Mask on face, I ain't Zorro
Fuckin' on dude lookin' like Antonio, bitch
Never sign nothin' who sold you those, bitch?
Let me build my portfolio, bitch
Gotta fight the urge
Fight the urge to talk my shit
Fight the urge to fuck yo' bitch
Fight the urge to keep gettin' rich
Fight the-
Fight, fight, fight the urge
Gotta fight the urge to keep gettin' rich, ah
Cross that line, it's a flat-line
And you out of time like a deadline
Somebody gon' bleed red wine
If a nigga step on my landmine
Hope my guys don't face (fed time)
A renaissance god, I'm like Greg Hine
Speak my mind, it's another headline
This blood look orange, call him Dev Hynes (woo)
I don't wear ESSENTIALS 'cause I'm quintessential
Influential on the instrumental
I'm intricate, the flow sentimental
I'm unconventional, the GRIM is mental
Yeah, I look like Thugnificent
Will someone tell the judge I'm innocent
I peep how they tried to cancel him
Then resubscribe for the membership
Fight the urge
Make them bite the curb
Might just strike a nerve
Not the type to wife a bird
I just might just buy a spur
So I can write your curse
Pop a nerve, I heard you like to swerve
Hahaha (swerve, swerve, swerve, swerve)
Gotta fight the urge
Fight the urge to talk my shit
Fight the urge to fuck yo' bitch
Fight the urge to keep gettin' rich
Fight the-
Fight, fight, fight the urge
Gotta fight the urge to keep gettin' rich, ah
Loced out, pistol grip in the trunk, stunt blunt
Got me doing some stupid shit, monkey bitches make me click
Loced out, pistol grip in the trunk, stunt blunt
