(Man)
(This happened one, two, three times, too much)
(These dumb-ass niggas)

Niggas ain't shit, come up in your crib
All up in your fridge, can't pay rent
Look at what you did, listen to your friends
When they say niggas ain't shit, 'cause

Niggas ain't shit, come up in your crib
All up in your fridge, can't pay rent
Look at what you did, listen to your friends
When they say niggas ain't shit, 'cause

You can say that again
Niggas is square like Madison
I can't even really get mad at them
They fall, then I gotta facepalm
Shook him like an 8-ball and it’s embarrassin'
Ten-page text, shoulda' wrote a book
Coulda' made a bag, but he broke
And he still waitin' 'til I can chill
And he really think I'ma get back to him

Doin' too much, relax a bit
Actin' like that 'cause your dad's a bitch
Must be the way that the planet is
Must be your face, 'cause it's not your dick
I’m a freak, not a masochist
Shoulda' known you had the baddest bitch
Left on read and can't give head
Baby, you ain't shit, eat a laxative

Niggas ain't shit, come up in your crib
All up in your fridge, can't pay rent
Look at what you did, listen to your friends
When they say niggas ain't shit, 'cause

Niggas ain't shit, come up in your crib
All up in your fridge, can't pay rent
Look at what you did, listen to your friends
When they say, niggas ain't shit, 'cause

Said that's not cheating if I wasn't with your ass, yo
You kept secrets and your cousin told me that, so
Logical thinkin' is just something that you lack, so
What you even mad for?
Lookin' like a stick up in your asshole

I'm not your mommy, nigga
Find a new hobby, nigga
Until your phone get picked up
Your shit's in the lobby, nigga
I'm not gon' key your car
I'll call your fuckin' mom
You should have paid my rent
Go get a fucking job

Niggas ain't shit, come up in your crib
All up in your fridge, can't pay rent
Look at what you did, listen to your friends
When they say niggas ain't shit, 'cause

Niggas ain't shit, come up in your crib
All up in your fridge, can't pay rent
Look at what you did, listen to your friends
When they say niggas ain't shit, 'cause

Baby, when you fought me at the door
Kinda hard to force what's natural
Maybe you don't want what you need most
Is it crazy I'm not scared to be alone?
Now, I barely need ya
Do what you do best and be (alone)
Gotta tell him, "Rest in peace"
Bet you thought I'd die (alone)
It don't make sense to me
But I'll keep my head up high (alone)
You ain't even there for me
Now you're scared to be (alone)
Too many drinks to think about you
I had too many thoughts to you let you wander
Now you're an afterthought, I lost ya
And now you want me, babe, you want me, but it's bye
Givin' me reasons to fly
Pack all my shit and be wise
Jump in the ride
Hit up my dude on the side
Like look what you do to the side
You get the vibe
Either we fuck or we fight
But I got the feelin' you right
I'm out my mind
Doesn't make sense when I cry
If we can't make up, 'least we try
Baby, when you fought me at the door (fought me at the door)
Kinda hard to force what's natural (oh, oh, oh)
Maybe you don't want what you need most (oh, oh, oh)
Is it crazy I'm not scared to be alone? (Yeah)
I ain't wanna share my dreams when it involves you
Not the man I need (yeah)
Started feelin' like I failed my team
Missin' gigs for you, bet you never felt like me
Different levels to the game, that's fair
Spendin' bands last week while your ass act cheap (yeah)
Lonely at the top while your ass miles deep
Got me thinkin' that you scared of yourself, not me
Impossible, from a Prius to gold carriages
Middle finger to you so you see what a whole karat is
I need a answer, a reader of more tarots
You couldn't tell that the both of us needed a whole therapist
I made you fam when I greeted your whole parents
But later, I realized they ain't teach you what no sharin' is
I know you hearin' this, I know you scared of it
But bein' lonely better than needs to control, cherish it (oh, oh, oh)
Baby, when you fought me at the door (when you fought me at the door)
Kinda hard to force what's natural (oh, oh, oh)
Maybe you don't want what you need most (oh, oh, oh)
Is it crazy I'm not scared to be alone?
Now I barely need ya (I barely need ya)
Do what you do best and be (alone)
Gotta tell him, "Rest in peace"
Bet you thought I'd die (alone)
It don't make sense to me
But I'll keep my head up high (alone)
You ain't even there for me
Now you're scared to be (alone)

Love got me fucked up
Got me on stuck, chasing that rush
Had to give in, couldn't give up
I just want you, but I don't do drugs
Still I want you, ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
All I want is you, ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
Baby, I've been in my bag
You don't really hit me back
'Cause I feel like I'm attached
Should've never kissed you back
Ever since I fell in love
Not quite like being trapped
More like a sickness that
Keeps me addicted bad
Hard for me to let you go (let you go, let you go)
My body wouldn't let me hide it (hide it)
No matter what, I wouldn't fall (wouldn't fall, wouldn't fall)
Fightin' through the thunder, lightning
Forgive me, I brought it upon mysеlf
(Ooh, woah, oh, oh, oh, oh)
Needed a fix of you, not just a kiss from you
I needed more
Lovе got me fucked up
Got me on stuck, chasing that rush
Had to give in, couldn't give up
I just want you, but I don't do drugs
Still I want you, ooh-ooh (all I want is, my baby)

Tryna stay in my lane
But you play on the safe side
But you fuckin' me up on this FaceTime
Faded, pourin' all over you
Know exactly what I wanna do
So, baby, can you eat it from the back?
Got me purrin' like I'm Doja Cat
Keep me in your bag
'Cause you wanna hear me say I'm coming back
But this time I want support, just make it last, ooh-woah, oh
It's hard for me to let you go (let you go)
My body wouldn't let me hide it
No matter what, I wouldn't fold (wouldn't fold)
Ridin' through the thunder, lightning
Forgive me, I brought it upon myself

I ain't givin' you one in public

Sign first, middle, last, on the wisdom tooth
Niggas wishin' that the pussy was a kissin' booth
Taste breakfast, lunch and gin and juice

(La-la-la-la-la, la-la, la-la-la-la-la, ah-ah)
You can leave open windows, don't care who see me out my clothes, baby
(Oh-oh, oh)
Yeah, I like bananas and peaches
And some might say it's indecent
That's just crazy (that's just crazy)
Can I slide outta mine and into yours?
Heels on, waiting at your door
I don't wanna play no more, leave everything on the floor
You don't need a pole to see me strip
Only thing I want zipped is your lips
Take it to the top, boy, skinny dip
(So hot, your body on mine, your body on)
I don't even wanna get a grip
I just like it when you grab my hips
Can you feel it through your fingertips? (How do I?)
How do I keep this on?
How do I let you know?
Boy, you deserve a show
Deserve to get comfortable, it's only natural
I could tell when you locked the door just what was going on
Boy, can we take off all our clothes?
When can we take off all our clothes?
When can we take off all our clothes? (When? Oh, whoa)
When can we take off all our clothes?
Baby, you're so anxious, you can't take it
Can we take this off and get naked?
Can we take this off and get naked?
Can we take this off and get nake-?
Baby, you're so anxious, you can't take it
Can we take this off and get naked?
Can we take this off and get naked?
Can we take this off and get naked? Ah
Follow me to my dressing room
Let me know if you ain't 'bout that NSFW
Now it's safe to finish what we started
First impression of you is you really like to party
Swirling all up on you 'cause you know I wanna dance
Let me cordially invite you to this party in my pants
How you got me sprung and don't say sorry in advance?
Show me all your tatt's, not just the ones that's on your hands
Who's your designer? Is that birthday suit one of a kind, uh?
Everything about you look like it's on purpose
God was working, probably took some extra time though
Ayy, all up in my curves like a puzzle piece, mmm
Jigsaw, let me see your muscleses, mmm
After we fuck, I'ma wanna cuddle
We could take it to the kitchen
I'll be on the island, come and eat, mmm
How do I keep this on?
How do I let you know?
Boy, you deserve a show
Deserve to get comfortable, it's only natural
I could tell when you locked the door just what was going on
Boy, can we take off all our clothes?
Anxious, you can't take it
(Can we take this off and get naked?) When can we take off all our clothes?
(Can we take this off and get naked?)
(Can we take this off and get naked?) When can we take off all our clothes?
(Feeling so anxious, can't take it)
(Can we take this off and get naked?) When can we take off all our clothes?
(Can we take this off and get naked?)
(Can we take this off and get naked? Ah)
Touch, touch my body

I don't need loving, late-night cuffing
Take it all off, you naughty
Put it back on and pause it
Kitchen, island, bedroom, closet
Takin' that elsewhere, maybe
We know we both got options
I know you faded, boy

Went to get Hen' and Coke

Giving him paranoia
He just wanna smash on tour
Fucking for the new velours

I can't imagine what you might try
Yeah, you so full of surprises, guess you one of my vices
You want a picket fence and a wife?
You never change your mind when I cry
Yeah, I see you flossing, you know it
Dropping your jaw when the drawers hit the floor
I don't need loving, late-night cuffing
Take it all off, you naughty

But you got me on a drain like a drunkie
Looking at the junk in your trunk like a junkie

And if she like freaks, we must try a threesome
Do it on the beach, in the sand, let me see some'
Seashells on the shore, I'm a beach bum
Finna eat some' when you come
Baby, don't you wanna let me know?
Laying on my bed like a vegetable
Lied when you said, "Never let me go"
Just like a pole, you professional
Stand on your hand 'cause you flexible
Now she tryna fuck me in the restroom or the parking lot
At the restaurant, anywhere, everywhere, anytime, I
