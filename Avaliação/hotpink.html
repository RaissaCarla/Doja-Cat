It's Doja
I don't know how I should tell you this but
I got one way, maybe this will work
You just gotta listen, closely to me
I need you
Me, us
Addicted, uh
I am addicted, a little
Under the influence, a little
And it makes me want to dance, a little
An itch I just can't scratch, addiction
I've got such a pretty body
Looks prettier when I'm a mess
And I just like to call him daddy
'Cause the first one he up and left
And you can relate to broken girls
I've been a day without it, I'm proud of myself
Baby can you break the curse?
I'm still gonna believe in magic
You can relate to broken girls
I've been a day without it, I'm proud of myself
Baby can you break the curse?
I'm still gonna believe in magic
I am addicted, a little
Under the influence, a little
And it makes me want to dance, a little
An itch I just can't scratch, addiction
Look
I'm just a little bit, I'm just a little bit (oh na-na)
I'm just a little bit, I'm just a little bit (na, na, na, na-na)
I'm just a little bit, I'm just a little bit (oh na-na)
I'm just a little bit, I'm just a little bit (na, na, na, na-na)
More, just a little bit more, just a little bit (oh na-na)
More, just a little bit more, just a little bit (na, na, na, na-na)
More, just a little bit more, just a little bit (oh na-na)
More, just a little bit more, just a little bit (na, na, na, na-na)
Yeah, roll another hunnid
We could get that white girl lit like Madonna
Bitch, I ain't Gwen but this shit is bananas
We could make the whole body drip like a sauna
Swim like a piranha, put M's in my water
I can't feel my lips, my limbs feel like rubber
Yeah I came down, but I still need another
One under the tongue and then a little marijuana
They on a trees like koala
I am addicted, a little
Under the influence, a little
And it makes me want to dance, a little
An itch I just can't scratch, addiction
Look
I'm just a little bit, I'm just a little bit (oh na-na)
I'm just a little bit, I'm just a little bit (na, na, na, na-na)
I'm just a little bit, I'm just a little bit (oh na-na)
I'm just a little bit, I'm just a little bit (na, na, na, na-na)
More, just a little bit more, just a little bit (oh na-na)
More, just a little bit more, just a little bit (na, na, na, na-na)

Messin' with my man, shawty
You cruisin' for a bruisin'
Don't gotta be slimy, honey
Swagger's what I'm oozin'
And they call her a trick
Because all she got is illusions
We walk in the room
And complement each other smoothly
'Member how I kissed you upside down
Like in that movie
Let God be the judge
And we can get rid of these Judy's
Better than me (better than me)
Better than me (she ain't better than me, baby)

And I beat her without violence
When it's heavy on me
It's like a brick on my ring, yeah
Baby on me, 'cause I got red in my genes, uh
Work 'til I cry, bitch, I ain't rarely got sleep
Kept the ice on my grill for me to get outta this heat
Ruby red, bright, bright
Diamonds on shine, should be legally blind
Just smile pearl white, white
Diamonds on shine, if I ever can find 'em (Shine)
Dun-dun, d-dun, d-dun-dun-dun-dun (Shine bright)
Dun-dun, d-dun, d-dun-dun-dun (Shine)
D-d-dun-dun, d-dun, d-dun, d-d-dun-dun (Shine bright)
Dun-dun, d-dun, d-dun, d-d-dun-dun (Shine)
Shine

(Letra)

I've been goin' through some things (oh)
I struggle with my inner man (yeah, yeah)
I hustle, I'll do what I can to get this money
Blaq Tuxedo
Don Dada on the, Don Dada on the beat
Like you, like you
Like you, ooh
I found it hard to find someone like you
Like you, like you
Send your location, come through
I can't sleep no more
In my head, we belong
And I can't be without you
Why can't I find no one like you?
I can't sleep no more
In my head, we belong
And I can't be without you
Why can't I find no one like you?
Baby, we tried to fight it
We all been there some days
Thought I needed something else
And acted like I was okay
We just had to work it out
And baby, I needed space
Ain't nobody 'round here on your level
You're so far away
You're pouring your heart out
I'm acting like I knew
You held me so down
So down I never grew, oh
I tried to find out
When none of them came through
And now I'm stuck in the middle
And baby had to pull me out, oh
Like you, like you
Like you, ooh
I found it hard to find someone like you
Like you, like you
Send your location, come through (yeah)
Damn papa, you a rare breed, no comparing
And it's motherfuckin' scary
Tryna keep him 'cause I found him
Let a hoe know I ain't motherfuckin' sharing
I could take you to the parents, then to Paris
Plan a motherfuckin' wedding
You the type I wanna marry (yeah) and keep you merry
I'll put the ring on when you ready
We play our fantasies out in real life ways and
No Final Fantasy, can we end these games though?
You give me energy, make me feel lightweight
Like the birds of a feather, baby
We real life made for each other
And it's hard to keep my cool
When other bitches tryna get with my dude and
When other chickens tryna get in my coop
'Cause you're a one in a million
There ain't no man like you
Like you, like you
Like you, ooh
I found it hard to find someone like you
Like you, like you
Send your location, come through
I can't sleep no more
In my head, we belong
And I can't be without you
Why can't I find no one like you?
I can't sleep no more
In my head, we belong
And I can't be without you
Why can't I find no one like you?

Closer to me baby, I won't bite
You look so tasty, but I won't bite
Really, I'm such a good kitty, don't put up fights
But if you trick me, baby, it gon' get sticky

He just wanna get head often
Why the fuck you in my bed all day?
Talking 'bout you getting bread
'Less you is a bird, then I understand, okay
Never ever bite the hand feeding you the worm
These are not your eggs, okay, look, look, look
Long ass money with a short fuse
I'm 5'3", but I'll make that nigga 4'2"
If you wanna do it, motherfucker

Do it for the glory (Wow)
Late to the shift, be sweet
Kept my voice high C and I let my braids drop
Don't give a fuck who see
Nigga D-E-F 'bout to throw grenades
Keep a ghetto freak, but she lightin' sage
Natural hair poppin', don't ever get it twisted
She at your scalp for the fame
Nah, nah, nah, nigga, listen, let me lecture, see
When it be about the bread
Oh, went to Quiznos, don't test it, ayy
I'm a gentleman, I turn to a barracuda
Swimming in your blessings, hey
Higher than a hallelujah
Hot as halitosis, she lick me like
(La, la la la, la la la, la la la, la)
Closer to me baby, I won't bite
You look so tasty, but I won't bite
