Pull up in the '97 Benz (baby, get up in)
Sexy with that fire truck red (with the windows tinted)
Smokin' while I cruise through the valley (you so ignorant)
Looks like we don't give a shit (looks like we don't give a shit)
Looks like we don't give a shit (looks like we don't give a shit)
Looks like we don't give a shit (looks like we don't give a shit)
Looks like we don't give a shit (looks like we don't give a shit)
Looks like we don't give a shit (looks like we don't give a)
Yeah, I ain't got no skeletons in my luxury walk-in
They ain't know I'm innocent, baby, look who is talkin'
They ain't even ready spaghetti, baby, they sauceless
Speedin' through the city, we medicated the horses
You could hit up PETA., the paint on me make me gorgeous
I'ma take the geese and chinchilla coat on a walk and
Don't forget the cheetah print, speed up, come here, record it
If that shit ain't bleedin' and screamin' I do not want it
Take it back
Pull up in the '97 Benz (baby, get up in)
Sexy with that fire truck red (with the windows tinted)
Smokin' while I cruise through the valley (you so ignorant)
Looks like we don't give a (looks like we don't give a shit)
Said looks like we don't give a shit (looks like we don't give a shit)
Looks like we don't give a shit (looks like we don't give a shit)
Looks like we don't give a shit (looks like we don't give a shit)
Looks like we don't give a shit (looks like we don't give a)
Yeah, said if these are clothes, motherfucker, what are those?
You look like a butter face, butter body, butter toes
I put Can't Believe It on my early morning butter toast
Y'all cannot believe I'm not a fiend and that it wasn't coke
You look so uncomfortable
You could have a seat and several hundred mo'
Hop up off my D just like a bunny go
Hop up out the scene and now they want it mo', I don't know
I like when they plead and beggin', "Please, now where the fuck is Doj'?"
Pull up and they smiley instead (actin' stupid)
Like they wasn't tryna fight me in Threads ('bout some music)
In a tweet that I'ma probably still stand by (I'm ruthless)
Keep ya money, funky bitch, 'cause I don't play about the (the rumors)
They gon' buy it, they gon' pirate, they gon' play it, they consume it
If you scootin', let me know 'cause that's a comment, that's a view
And that's a ratin', that's some hatin', that's engagement, I could use and
I could teach y'all how to do this, but I'd much rather be cruisin'
Watch me pull up in the '97 Benz (baby, get up in)
Sexy with that fire truck red (with the windows tinted)
Smokin' while I cruise through the valley (you so ignorant)
Looks like we don't give a shit, said (looks like we don't give a shit)
Looks like we don't give a shit (looks like we don't give a shit)
Looks like we don't give a shit, yeah (looks like we don't give a shit)
Looks like we don't give a shit, huh (looks like we don't give a shit)
Looks like we don't give a shit, huh (looks like we don't give a)
Looks like we don't
'Cause we don't, motherfucker
That's 'cause we don't, little bitch
That's 'cause we don't

Hope you can handle the heat
Put your name in the streets
Get used to my fans looking at you
Fuck what they heard, I don't fuck with them birds
I'm a mean kitty, don't get stabbed with the rat tooth
Boys be mad that I don't fuck incels
Girls hate too, gun to their pigtail
I love you, I wanna big chill
Boy, don't trip, I'll split a big bill

When I need my space, you give that
When he broke my heart, you fixed that
With a long walk on the beach
Love it when they honk-honk on the street
When they see us zoom by in the Jeep
We a whole damn joint, we an energy
Baby, we could just ride on our enemies
They all wanna know how you get to me
Let 'em feel how they feel and be Philistines
'Cause this type of love's the epitome, said

Baby, if you like it
Just reach out and pet it
This one doesn't bite
It doesn't get aggressive
Show you how to touch it
Hold it like it's precious
It don't need your lovin'
It just needs attention
It needs, it seeks affection
(So sweet)
Hungry, it fiends attention
(Hungry)
It needs, it seeks affection
(Baby)
Hungry (yeah), it fiends (yeah)
Look at me, look at me, you lookin'?
My taste good, but I just had to redirect my cookin'
I coulda been an opener, I redirect the bookin'
I read it, all the comments sayin', "D, I'm really shooketh"
"D, you need to see a therapist, is you lookin'?"
Yes, the one I got, they really are the best
Now I feel like I can see you bitches is depressed
I am not afraid to finally say shit with my chest
Lost a lil' weight, but I ain't never lost a tushy
Lookin' good, but now my bald head match my-
Lookin' good, but now they all sayin' that I'm ugly
Boo-hoo, my nigga, I ain't sad you won't fuck me
I'm sad that you really thought your ass was above me
You're lucky 'cause I just paid your bill with a reply
I just made your money pile knee high
I just made your stats peak, now you got a blue check
Now you can afford to go and reinstall a new wig
Now you can afford to not be lousy, go and do shit
Talk your shit about me, I can easily disprove it, it's stupid
You follow me, but you don't really care about the music
Baby, if you like it
Just reach out and pet it
This one doesn't bite
It doesn't get aggressive
Show you how to touch it
Hold it like it's precious
It don't need your lovin'
It just needs attention
It needs, it seeks affection
(So sweet)
Hungry, it fiends attention
(Hungry)
It needs, it seeks affection
(Baby)
Hungry, it fiends (yeah)
Look at me, look at me, I'm naked
Vulnerability earned me a lot of bacon
I put a thong all in my ass and taught you how to shake it
I paid all my respect to those who taught me how to make it
And now I reap the benefits with no confrontation
Y'all fall into beef but that's another conversation
I'm sorry, but we all find it really entertaining
'Cause we all wanna see them slip and fall right on their faces
And we all wanna be the one to see the devastation
Not be in it, but ain't the bad press good?
The disrespect's real, how this Patek look?
Pull out the checkbook, now why your neck crooked?
I never learn to superstar from a textbook
Talkin' 'bout, "She fallin' off, why she get booked?"
Man, I been humble, I'm tired of all the deprecation
Just let me flex, bruh, just let me pop shit
"Why she think she Nicki M? She think she hot shit, " hmm
I never gave a F, go stir the pot, bitch
I got y'all head all in the dirt just like a ostrich
Of course, you bitches comparin' Doja to who the hottest
Baby, if you like it
Just reach out and pet it
This one doesn't bite
It doesn't get aggressive
Show you how to touch it
Hold it like it's precious
It don't need your lovin'
It just needs attention
It needs, it seeks affection

All the things I do
All the plans I move
All the men I shoo
Mm, boy, I can't wait to get next to you
I can't wait to get next to you
I can't wait to get next to you
Can't wait to get next to you
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah
Here's another one about you
Baby, I wanna gush about you
I wanna be the stubborn crust of barnacles upon you
If you were to become a middle-American farmer
I'd read up on every vegetable and harvest them around you
Not to be too much, but I am always me around you
But when you leave I'm moving very awkwardly without you
I have never met a man who gets it like you do
Precious as you are
You're cursing out your mirror
You're takin' it too far
You need to see it clearer
I've seen it all before
I wanna be there for you when the goings getting hard
When you're feelin' like the lowest thing that no one even wants
I wanna write you poetry, and jokes, and even songs
I hope this lasts forever, or at least 'til we a hundred
Please know how much I want this
All the things I do
All the plans I move
All the men I shoo
Mm, boy, I can't wait to get next to you
I can't wait to get next to you
I can't wait to get next to you
Can't wait to get next to you (yeah)
And I wouldn't do this for no man
It's a understatement if I tell you you's important
I'm just tryna bring you drinks and assortments
Hot towels with a mocktail by the ocean
Top-down with our ice shinin' like a snowman
Cook you a crab boil that reminds you of New Orleans
Don't give any time of day to these cokeheads
We too busy getting experience and exploring
I wanna take you overseas and stop by in Paris
And watch you taste the cheese
Take you to Buly and get you smellin' sweet
In love with you, je suis
I love you, mon chéri
And if you feel the need to dip and take a breather
Just know that I will wait or that I'd never leave
I'm giving you space, giving you cover, uh-huh
Giving you true love in abundance, uh-huh
Giving and taking because we're not a fling
Giving me faith that it's not another
All the things I do
All the plans I move
All the men I shoo
Mm, boy, I can't wait to get next to you
I can't wait to get next to you (I can't wait, no, I can't wait)
I can't wait to get next to you (yeah, I can't wait, boy, I can't wait)
Can't wait to get next to you (no, I can't wait)
Can't wait
No, I

She don't care if you famous, don't play, or you get fired
Her taste is all acquired, she sing just like a choir
These bitches all admire, she buildin' her empire
Lil' mama, go off
'Cause she might just pop, do not get it messed up
She that bitch in charge, she the real top dog
She gon' fuck shit up if your ass get smart
Lil' mama, go off, lil' mama, go off
