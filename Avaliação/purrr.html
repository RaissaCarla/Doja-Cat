Powder, set, yes
Came out impressed
Kill them in that dress
(Kill them in that)
I'm beautiful
I know it's so
I'm beautiful [x2]
See you in that
Powder, set yes
Came out impressed
Kill them in that dress [x2]
Hey, Nayima
'Sup Sabrina
Hey, Naomi
Love your features
With a little bit of rouge on the cheek
Bronze little bombshells cruise by the beach
Louis on the clutch, 'Boutin on the feets
I'm doing too much with your dude in the sheets
Now you soft like 300 count
Little rubber band tuckin' 300 thou'
Throw it on the floor, make 300 bounce
Can you make a 16 come out 300 mouths?
Cause I might have the check in the mail
I might get 'em wetter like I'm underneath the sail
Hungry little bunny I am coming for your kale
So I can keep my mommy up and spend a hundred on the nails
As usual
I'm suitable
Cute from the cooch to my cuticle
And boo, you should know
I'm so doable
It's quite provable
That we beautiful
And it ain't about being good looking
It's your brains, how they working
Get that good sookie-sookie
I'm sorry if your man can't stop lookie-looking
Mistook me for a ho', and ain't nobody playing hookie
And you ain't found your girl on Tinder yet
The cookie like a temple, you can call it gingerbread
Be a good example at least on the internet
Shorty posting all them selfies
Help me, is you single yet?
Tell me, is you into head?
Cause maybe we can intersect
Cos sexually you interest
Boy, visually you is a yes
(No respect!)
And you dudes don't do your duty
Can't see me shake my head at you
Too focused on the booty
You bastard bachelors
Is really acting like you're Clooney
Ya'll truly won't be players
Til you learn to see the beauty
(Male groupies!)
Can't say I blame you if I was you I would do me
I'm a cutie-patootie but don't mistake that for hoochie
Cause even if you think you knew me
A woman changes with the seasons
And I'm breathing out the new me

I act like I don't want you
Like it's whatever
Shit it ain't a thing
When really I wanna flaunt you
You really need a queen
So be a, be a king
Anything you know, you might have every idea
Anything you know, you might have every idea

I'm not under your CONTROL
Baby you ain't got the whole, no

Whee-ooh whee-ooh, whee-ooh, whee-ooh
They say I bang
They never toy with me
Royal from the crown to my fucking feet
They say talk that talk
Walk but please avoid the streets
Lock the jaw, lock the door
Avoid the speech
'Cause once you speak
Bullshit reek like oil leak
Pop a pill, cop a feel
Rock the lease
How the fuck you do that in them denim jeans?
All these bars, no police
Whee-ooh whee-ooh, whee-ooh whee-ooh
All these bars, no police
Whee-ooh whee-ooh, whee-ooh whee-ooh (pop a zany – free)
All these bars, no police
He calls me copper tone
Smoking ultraviolet
We turn off the phone
I'm in autopilot
Make that disappear
Mr. Copperfield
When we ride he bust them tricks
I lean and pop a wheel
Watching brandy sipping brandy
Panties on the marble floor
Guess my pants is fancy
Bitches acting catty on the set
Make your man tap me on his neck
Or tap me on your back
Mmm, that's nasty but I'm classy with this shit
So pop a couple xanies for me quick
Pop a couple xanies for me quick
Pop a couple xanies for me bitch
Whee-ooh whee-ooh, whee-ooh whee-ooh
All these bars, no police
Whee-ooh whee-ooh, whee-ooh whee-ooh (pop a zany – free)
All these bars, no police
Yellow bars, get it in
Somehow this shit medicine
Feel that slow high setting in
Let it take you to a place you ain't never been
Like floating on cotton candy clouds
Shirt and panties on the ground
This kitties hot, fan it down
Make moves on me, papi, don't stand around
One for you, one for me, when we break a half
Your gentle touch on my naked ass
These summer nights, when that AC blast
Them bars put easy a crazy pass so
Baby if you need it come and get it
Just can't hold this back from you
Now pop this with me

With the nunchucks
Rolling in your hood
Ask a big bad wolf what is good
Feeling dumbstruck
I done been there, done that
But I wonder why I still feel so alone
Baby, stand up
But don't pull them pants up
You're pulling off my shirt
But should I leave my hands up?
Expression of fandom
You know that I've been good
But you still tear the cat up
And when you provoke me
You do it at random
I won't lead you on
But I hope that you can manage
You don't want to man up
You don't want to plan up
But you call me wifey
So what's the big idea?
Do I need to sit right here and fill my ears
While bullshit come out of your lips right here
Got me searching for insight
Insight? Guess I need to call this night off
Riddle me riddle me that
Mr. Unintentional Ass
And his every interval fast -
Throw that cheese and dough in that bag
With that Little Italy swag
Nigga, riddle riddle me that
Why my mental instantly crash
When you enter, enter me
Gentle then, yeah, ease up
I'm day dreaming
Now, whoa, I never daydream
But you jumping from rooftops
And searching and hunting, my ninja
With the nunchucks
Rolling in your hood
Ask a big bad wolf what is good
Feeling dumbstruck
I done been there, done that
But I wonder why I still feel so alone

Blow, weed, coke, pop X
Speedin' up the heartbeat bangin' in my chest
When you put it on me, you relieve my stress
You got me so high, takin' deep, deep breaths
You get me so high, you get me so high
I know you ain't a drug, but you get me so high
You get me so high, you get me so high
I know you ain't a drug, but you get me so high
You get me so high, you get me so high
I know you ain't a drug, but you get me so high
You get me so high, you get me so high
You get me so high, you get me so high, high
You got me so turnt up, this dude gotta be so high
Weed always on my mind, now he always on my mind

You ain't gotta say a word, just spark that, let's get burnt, uh
Then we'll roll up a hunnid fuckin' blunts

And we sippin' on that juicy-juice

Man, this shit these drugs will do to you
Blow, weed, coke, pop X
Speedin' up the heartbeat bangin' in my chest
When you put it on me, you relieve my stress
You got me so high, takin' deep, deep breaths
You get me so high, you get me so high
I know you ain't a drug, but you get me so high
You get me so high, you get me so high
I know you ain't a drug, but you get me so high
You get me so high, you get me so high
I know you ain't a drug, but you get me so high
You get me so high, you get me so high
You get me so high, you get me so high, high
Six hits, ten pounds, gone off the dro

Gone off the dro, gone off the dro
