Finna be up ah, yea-uh, finna be up ah, yea-uh
Finna be up ain't no sleepin' all night, yuh
Yuh, we up 'til the day break off, make up when I take, take off
No sleep, you my sunshine though, just me, you, and some wine, look
'Cause we trynna unwind, look, we sleep baby, sometimes, look
Yeah, we got the same schedule, sexual drive, speed through,
I just led you
Spent 15 on it and that's fine,
'cause we already been around five
Lil weed, Hennessy, kinda sound nice,
Finna need new sheets by around nine
Feelin' weak in the knees, make it bounce like bla-bla-bla
Bed smack to the wall tap-tap-tap
Wait, lemme throw it all back-back-back
Neighbor bangin' the door
Ain't no sleepin', fuck Monday, it's the weekend 'til Sunday
Add one moon, we'll be sunlight, he love that t-shirt, no undies
Ain't no sleepin', fuck Monday, it's the weekend 'til Sunday
Add one moon, we'll be sunlight, he love that t-shirt, no undies okay

Finna be up, ain't no sleepin' all night, yuh
Finna be up ah, yea-uh, finna be up ah, yea-uh
Finna be up ain't no sleepin' all night, yuh
Baby I just clocked out
In the middle of the night, need a snorkel
Ain't tryna knock out
Still workin' on my wine, need a back rub
Wish we could rewind to the bathtub
First night, wreckin' this suite, no pack up
Tuck me lent money in the mattress
But we ain't finna sleep on the mattress
Practice, knee-deep in your tactic
Back it up, beep beep, no Uhaul
Tossed salad, no cheese, no croutons
Set it down, taste cheap, no coupon
No drugs, this new guy, he's on
Five star, that's sweet, no futon
Damn my other girl tired, Tsundere
I ain't talkin' 'bout the tea when I Oolong
Ain't no sleepin', fuck Monday, it's the weekend 'til Sunday
Add one moon, we'll be sunlight, he love that t-shirt, no undies
Ain't no sleepin', fuck Monday, it's the weekend 'til Sunday
Add one moon, we'll be sunlight, he love that t-shirt
No undies okay, yeah

All in all, we pullin' all ni-i-i-ighters
We ain't gotta turn on them li-i-i-ights

I think I need something new, something you got for me
I'm the one to give it to, to get into, I'm ready
I'ma get comfortable
'Cause you know I won't be here all week
And we both got it in, off free
We ain't afraid of sexuality, oh
No games, no way Jos√©, foreplay, don't fake, both ways
Like olay, and I won't chase to it, OJ
Soul based, and on face like I'm Colgate
Hallways when I go all day, get it, uh huh
Now it's the one to throw it back with it
Fittin' all that, he ain't gotta call back
Trippin' this, prison this, nigga I don't get it
I'm addicted
Reading all my feelings, need a oneway ticket
Looking so fly cuz I mind my business
So proposed, you know I'm vicious
Slow your roll, you can't lie to me baby
I see it on you, your eyes and your face
Won't be a snooze and go opposite ways
And I see you fiendin' going off on it babe
I don't need to speak, I'm not talkin' babe
'Cause you're talkin' with your body, body
Can we touch up on the topic, topic?
You're coming on to me
And I can read it all up on your face
Control it, get your way
Baby you can't hide from me and come and vibe with me
Boy it ain't my fault, it's building up inside of me
I hope I can get you off before you say goodbye to me
And boy it ain't my fault, it's building up inside of me
I hope I can get you off before you say goodbye to me
'Cause you're talkin' with your body, body
Can we touch up on the topic, topic?
Good self control but you stickin' it out, a figure, a mouth
Don't wonder why you twistin' your loud
Twerkin' it out and wonder why they thirstier now
Every night dodgin' broke niggas, curvin' 'em out
Like every pipe got its own feelings, lurkin' below
I mean, really? Do you love me? Is it certain, for sho?
I got money nigga, know you gon' be hurt if I don't
But I got niggas in my city and my bitches is cold, so
Tell me what you had in mind
Watch it closely, we'll unwind
Take all the G outta mine
You do your job, I'll do mine
'Cause the body doesn't lie
'Cause you're talkin' with your body, body
Can we touch up on the topic, topic?
'Cause you're talkin' with your body, body
Can we touch up on the topic, topic?
I think I need something new, something you got for me
I'm the one to give it to, to get into, I'm ready
I'ma get comfortable
'Cause you know I won't be here all week
And we both got an inner freak
We ain't afraid of sexuality, oh

I can name a couple ways, baby, this s- might go
You just might forget that this was what you're gettin' hyped for
Late at night, do the things to him, mean that guy who
Need someone who's sweet enough
Who'll shoot to make that high note
And it's such a typical thing
Runnin' over a billion men, ooh-ooh
Runnin' through a difficult place
You gon' meet a billion hands, ooh-ooh, ooh
She's just like candy, she's so sweet
But you know that it ain't real cherry
Know that it ain't real cherry
She's just like candy, she's so sweet
But you know that it ain't real
Know that it ain't real
I can be your sugar when you're fiendin' for that sweet spot
Put me in your mouth, baby, and eat it 'til your teeth rot
I can be your cherry, apple, pecan, or your key lime
Baby, I got everything and so much more than she's got
And it's such a typical thing
Runnin' over a billion men, ooh-ooh
Runnin' through a difficult place
You gon' meet a billion hands, ooh-ooh, ooh
She's just like candy, she's so sweet
But you know that it ain't real cherry
Know that it ain't real cherry
She's just like candy, she's so sweet
But you know that it ain't real

But you know that it ain't real cherry
Know that it ain't real cherry
She's just like candy, she's so sweet
But you know that it ain't real
Know that it ain't real
Sugar-coated, lies unfolded
You still lick the wrapper
It's addictive, you know this, but you still lick the wrapper
Sugar-coated, lies unfolded

Take it off, follow me now, let me in, don't shut me out
Don't tell me you love me if that's not how it really is
Take it off, follow me now, let me in, don't shut me out
Don't tell me you love me if that's not how it really is

Or are you tryna spend your life with me?
I don't mean to pressure you
But I want a man to stand and fight
Stand and fight for me
You don't need to paint me a sweet fantasy
We chill, I kick back, you roll up my weed
Say what you feel, don't just say anything
Why complicate what could be so easy?
Leave me alone
If you is a player I don't think I'ma play with you, uh huh
This shit get old
If you wanna lay with her
Why don't you just stay with her?
You say you don't want a girlfriend but when we are in person
You always act so different, you make it all seem perfect
You hold me when we wake up, say you like me with no make up
I'm tryin' to be patient, how am I supposed to take it?
Is it casual?
Or are you tryna spend your life with me?
I don't mean to pressure you
But I want a man to stand and fight for me
Is it casual?
Or are you tryna spend your life with me?
I don't mean to pressure you
But I want a man to stand and fight
Stand and fight for me
I'm sick of chillin', sippin' on Tecate
That life is a bore, we needed more than drunken Fridays
I'm not dissin' your freedom, I know you like to party
Just don't be that boy who fuck with anything that gyrate
I know you know I'm right, pick up on the vibe
If you read between the lines, bein' shy just ain't my style, now
You say you don't want a girlfriend but when we are in person
You always act so different, you make it all seem perfect
You hold me when we wake up, say you like me with no make up
I'm trying to be patient, how am I supposed to take it?

But I want a man to stand and fight, stand and fight for me
If you wanna be the one
Don't act sad and wait
And waste my day
I'm not that way
Is it casual?
Or are you tryna spend your life with me?
I don't mean to pressure you
But I want a man to stand and fight

Let the waves carry you down to my doorstep
Rest your weary souls on my shores, yeah
Sand and the sun and the tropical breeze, yeah
You can get away from the sharks in the seas, yeah
Wild out, make a name
Stars is out, freaky time
Sink the ship, take a dip
Coconut, take a sip
Wildfire, dance around
Wear my gold like a crown
Where we've been, given doubt
Where we are? In the wild now
Wild beach
Can't control these wild things
Can't you see you're drowning?
Tryna tame a wild beast, I'm a wild beach
It's like you're tryna tame a wild beast, I'm a wild beach
I'm a wild beach, I'm a wild beach
Boy, you must be crazy
Must be out of my mind
Feel like I'm stranded but it go hand in hand
'Cause we free to live that life
Now see that though
Pretty in a drop top, we gon' blow
Palm trees in a Backwood, he on both knees
Make it pop-pop, I don't need no doors
If crib pop-itty, I don't need more hoes
See no evil even if she won't go
Dijon chico with the neon coat
Got a vision of the sun, I just see more gold and
Wild out, make a name
Stars is out, freaky time
Sink the ship, take a dip
Coconut, take a sip
Wildfire, dance around
Wear my gold like a crown
Where we've been, given doubt
Where we are? In the wild now
Wild beach
Can't control these wild things
Can't you see you're drowning?
Tryna tame a wild beast, I'm a wild beach
It's like you're tryna tame a wild beast, I'm a wild beach
